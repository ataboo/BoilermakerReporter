# BoilermakerReporter

BMToolbox Reporter is a free app that creates Boilermaker Apprentice Reports that can be submitted as
PDF files.  It uses the awesome [PDFBox-Android](https://github.com/Birdbrain2/PdfBox-Android) library for PDF functionality.

This app isn't officially connected to any associations.  PDFs will only be saved and loaded in
the Downloads/BMReporter folder to protect the file system.  BMToolbox Reporter is a companion
to [Boilermaker Toolbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atasoft.flangeassist) 
and was separated to keep Toolbox lightweight and permission free.

Feelfree to mail bmtoolbox@gmail.com with any comments or suggestions.

### Changes:
#### V 1.01 (2/19/15):
- Fixed PDF templates that made Adobe Reader for Android crash
- Made ActionBar spinner update on file load of other type

#### V 1.0 (2/19/15):
- Initial release

### Notes:
- Form fields won't show up on Android Google Drive's PDF Viewer so I'd suggest Adobe Reader
