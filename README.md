# BoilermakerReporter

BMToolbox Reporter is a free app that creates Boilermaker Apprentice Reports that can be submitted as
PDF files.  It uses the awesome PDFBox-Android library for PDF functionality.

This app isn't officially connected to any associations.  PDFs will only be saved and loaded in
the Downloads/BMReporter folder to protect the file system.  BMToolbox Reporter is a companion
to Boilermaker Toolbox and was separated to keep Toolbox lightweight and permission free.

Feelfree to mail bmtoolbox@gmail.com with any comments or suggestions.
